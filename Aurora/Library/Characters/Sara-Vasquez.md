Sara was given to an orphanage whe she was only weeks old.
No one ever knew who here parents were or where she was born.
It was assumed she was born on Tython since it where she was found.

She grew up with other children until the age of 5 before she was adopted.
Still to this day she doesn't remember the years she spent there.
She was adopted by the Vasquez family on Tython where she had an older sister.
The got along fairly well since she was only a few years older than Sara.
