Sara was given to an orphanage whe she was only weeks old.
No one ever knew who here parents were or where she was born.
It was assumed she was born on Tython since it where she was found.

She grew up with other children until the age of 5 before she was adopted.
Still to this day she doesn't remember the years she spent there.
She was adopted by the Vasquez family on Tython where she had an older sister.
The got along fairly well since she was only a few years older than Sara.
It was pretty common to see children that had some ability with the force, but since the jedi order and the sith were no longer around to train them, their abilities never developed beyond telekinesis capabilities.
Sara displayed some form of force ability when she was playing with the other children at the orphanage.
She was able to make object levitate around her, much more easily and strongly than other children they had seen before.
No one believed she would develop her abilities further.

Whe she attended school she eventually managed to develop bonds with other children that were force sensitive easily, she had no trouble making friends.
Se eventually realized that she could affect minds with the force.
Those that we less strong with the force could be easily influenced and she became able to read their minds.
She tried to be discrete as much about this ability, no one since the jedi went extinct ever came close to her abilities.
At age 10 she became curious as to why she had such strong powers with the force without any training.
She learned that the sith and jedi went extinct hundreds of years ago and since then there has been a balance in the force.
She became worried that she could imbalance the force towards the light or the dark.
