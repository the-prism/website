# Sara Vasquez

Sara was given to an orphanage when she was only weeks old.
No one ever knew who here parents were or where she was born.
It was assumed she was born on Tython since it where she was found.

She grew up with other children until the age of 5 before she was adopted.
Still to this day she doesn't remember the years she spent there.
She was adopted by the Vasquez family on Tython where she had an older sister.
The got along fairly well since she was only a few years older than Sara.
It was pretty common to see children that had some ability with the force, but since the jedi order and the sith were no longer around to train them, their abilities never developed beyond telekinesis capabilities.
Sara displayed some form of force ability when she was playing with the other children at the orphanage.
She was able to make object levitate around her, much more easily and strongly than other children they had seen before.
No one believed she would develop her abilities further.

When she attended school she eventually managed to develop bonds with other children that were force sensitive easily, she had no trouble making friends.
Se eventually realized that she could affect minds with the force.
Those that we less strong with the force could be easily influenced and she became able to read their minds.
She tried to be discrete as much about this ability, no one since the jedi went extinct ever came close to her abilities.
At age 10 she became curious as to why she had such strong powers with the force without any training.
She learned that the sith and jedi went extinct hundreds of years ago and since then there has been a balance in the force.
She became worried that she could imbalance the force towards the light or the dark.

As she grew up she started to be more and more connected to the force than she previously thought.
During one of her meditations she was able to feel things and see other places on Tython, at first she was scared, but she eventually realized what it meant.
She meditated further and discovered an imbalance that was growing in the force, there was a darkness that was more and more present.
Sara knew that she had to preserve the balance in the force.
The jedi masters that were one with the force started to manifest themselves in her visions, giving her some insights on the ancient teachings of the light, and how to prevent darkness from taking over.
At the age of 16 she had force powers stronger than anyone had seen in years.
She talked to her parents about the situation that was developing but they didn't believe her.
After asking the master in one of her meditations they agreed to help her convince other that the jedi order needed to return.
Sara went to confront her parents one more time with the help of the masters that manifested themselves as visions.
Together they manage to convince them to rebuild the jedi order.

In a matter of months her parents managed to move around some funds and acquired some land outside the city to rebuild the jedi order.
Sara started teaching her sister [Alessandra](Alessandra-vasquez) in the ways of the force, their bond was so strong that it was easy for her to teach her how to use her force powers.
After a couple of months the both of them had mastered their force abilities to the point they could start teaching others.
By then their parents managed to get more involved with the republic the the new order was funded and protected by the republic.
The galactic stability was in peril as the federation and empire started to reinforce their borders.
There had been reports of force users attacking colonies on the border between, but neither the empire and the federation confirmed it.

When she was 20 she went on a trip across multiple worlds to find her lightsaber crystal.
She found her crystal in a cave on dantooine, after assembling her lightsaber the blade turned out the be a deep blue color.
As she started teaching others in the ways of the force at the temple on Tython, Sara started to gain interest in how to maintain balance in the force.
She learned to use some of the dark side powers, which she didn't tell anyone at the academy about.
As she learned more and more how to channel the full powers she had to be careful to not let her emotions take over.
Her lightsaber crystal eventually turned purple over time as she used more and more dark side powers trying to learn about them.
Unsure about what this meant she asked the old masters about this during one of her meditations.
She learned that the purple saber was achieved when the force user would reach a balance in the force, using both dark side and light side powers towards keeping a balance in the force.

She realized that the more and more she used the dark side powers she learned she would stray further away from the light and the only change at restoring balance.
It's evident that the previous attempt to restore balance that removed the jedi and sith from the galaxy didn't work.
It was without doubt inevitable that there would be children that would be strong with the force.
They had hoped that by not training anyone there would no longer be sith or jedi.
Whenever the dark or the light would succeed, the other would inevitably come back and the cycle would continue.

Sara decided to fast track the order, and start training padawans even though the order didn't have any masters yet.
Alessandra suggested that Sara became the first master but she refused, she knew that in her place she had to keep the balance, and that it could possibly lead to turning against the order.
The order needed to remain true to preserving the light, Sara was afraid that she would taint it with the dark side.
She didn't want to risk any of the padawans or even knights turning the dark side because of her influence.
By the time she reached 24, there were already 2 generations of jedi knights in the order, the first being the ones she trained personally.
It was time for the jedi council to return.
Alessandra and other formed the jedi council, the became the first jedi masters in years, and started training new padawans.

Sara and other jedi knights were mandated by the council to go aid the republic in the evolving situation.
The were assigned to the open circle fleet and deployed on the border with the empire where there had been reports of star destroyers getting close to republic worlds.
The tension was rising between the federation, the empire and the republic, no one wanted war but it seemed just around the corner.
The republic was getting worried about the reports that came in from attacks against the federation where lightsaber users attacked cities.
Since they could not intervene directly, they asked for the help of the jedi council once more.
Sara and 2 other jedi knights volunteered to infiltrate the federation and reach the region where those attacks were reported.
Meanwhile the other jedi knights patrolled the outskirts of republic space and kept an eye out for any move from the empire.
