Alessandra was born on Terra-Nova in 2107. She lived in a large city,
making a lot of friends and partying a lot. She was always active,

martial arts. She developed a passion for outdoors, she went on a lot of
camping trips during the weekend, often going out without much supplies,
surviving out there for weeks.

By the time she was 18, she enrolled into the Academy, joined at the
same time as Sara. They became good friends after a week, they did a lot
of thing together, from assignments to camping trips. By the time they
graduated from the academy, they were best friends. They both chose
different assignments, Alessandra preferred a front-line role, leading a
unit while Sara preferred to serve aboard a ship.

When Sara was recruited by the ONI, she also recommended that Alessandra
should be considered. She refused the offer at first, but when Sara came
to visit her; she convinced Alessandra to join the ONI. They both did
their black ops training together, by the end they were a super
effective unit. They were assigned as a pair different missions. As they
completed more and more missions, their superiors saw their potential as
a unit. Sara was promoted to Lieutenant Commander and given a ship, the
Alacrity. Alessandra was a bit disappointed at first, but since Sara
chose her as her second in command, she eventually went along with it.
