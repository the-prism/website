title: Working with third party API
---
Nothing brings more joy to a developper that integrating services with a third party. Using google's services in you application, or integrating with Facebook. It's easy, you download their client library, read the documentation and voila, you are good to go, in theory.

However you quickly hit problems when you can't use the client libraries. Often they will only support some versions of languages, mainly only the common stuff. If you work on older code bases or simply something that's not supported you are on your own.

There is some documentation but don't expect to be goind far with it. For example, the google documentation is a mess to navigated and understand where to make the api call, what data to expect and send. You end up reading a lot, looking on stack overflow, and trial and error. For the love of god, please document properly.
