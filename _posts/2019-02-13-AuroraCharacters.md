When I started the aurora project I had a lot of ideas in mind, I started writing characters and their backgrounds but never got around to finish it.

# Sara Vasquez

Sara was given to an orphanage when she was only weeks old. No one ever knew who here parents were or where she was born. It was assumed she was born on Tython since it where she was found.

## Growing up

She grew up with other children until the age of 5 before she was adopted. Still to this day she doesn't remember the years she spent there. She was adopted by the Vasquez family on Tython where she had an older sister. The got along well since she was only a few years older than Sara. It was common to see children that had some ability with the force, but since the jedi order and the sith were no longer around to train them, their abilities never developed beyond telekinesis capabilities. Sara displayed some form of force ability when she was playing with the other children at the orphanage. She was able to make object levitate around her, much more easily and strongly than other children they had seen before. No one believed she would develop her abilities further.

When she attended school she eventually managed to develop bonds with other children that were force sensitive easily, she had no trouble making friends. She eventually realized that she could affect minds with the force. Those that we less strong with the force could be easily influenced and she became able to read their minds. She tried to be discrete as much about this ability, no one since the jedi went extinct ever came close to her abilities. At age 10 she became curious as to why she had such strong powers with the force without any training. She learned that the sith and jedi went extinct hundreds of years ago and since then there has been a balance in the force. She became worried that she could imbalance the force towards the light or the dark.

## The new jedi order

As she grew up she started to be more and more connected to the force than she previously thought. During one of her meditations she was able to feel things and see other places on Tython, at first, she was scared, but she eventually realized what it meant. She meditated further and discovered an imbalance that was growing in the force, there was a darkness that was more and more present. Sara knew that she had to preserve the balance in the force. The jedi masters that were one with the force started to manifest themselves in her visions, giving her some insights on the ancient teachings of the light, and how to prevent darkness from taking over. At the age of 16 she had force powers stronger than anyone had seen in years. She talked to her parents about the situation that was developing but they didn't believe her. After asking the master in one of her meditations they agreed to help her convince other that the jedi order needed to return. Sara went to confront her parents one more time with the help of the masters that manifested themselves as visions. Together they manage to convince them to rebuild the jedi order.

In a matter of months her parents managed to move around some funds and acquired some land outside the city to rebuild the jedi order. Sara started teaching her sister Alessandra in the ways of the force, their bond was so strong that it was easy for her to teach her how to use her force powers. After a couple of months, the both had mastered their force abilities to the point they could start teaching others. By then their parents managed to get more involved with the republic the the new order was funded and protected by the republic. The galactic stability was in peril as the federation and empire started to reinforce their borders. There had been reports of force users attacking colonies on the border between, but neither the empire and the federation confirmed it.

When she was 20 she went on a trip across multiple worlds to find her lightsaber crystal. She found her crystal in a cave on Dantooine, after assembling her lightsaber the blade turned out the be a deep blue color. As she started teaching others in the ways of the force at the temple on Tython, Sara started to gain interest in how to maintain balance in the force. She learned to use some of the dark side powers, which she didn't tell anyone at the academy about. As she learned more and more how to channel the full powers she had to be careful to not let her emotions take over. Her lightsaber crystal eventually turned purple over time as she used more and more dark side powers trying to learn about them. Unsure about what this meant she asked the old masters about this during one of her meditations. She learned that the purple saber was achieved when the force user would reach a balance in the force, using both dark side and light side powers towards keeping a balance in the force.

She realized that the more and more she used the dark side powers she learned she would stray further away from the light and the only change at restoring balance. It's evident that the previous attempt to restore balance that removed the jedi and sith from the galaxy didn't work. It was without doubt inevitable that there would be children that would be strong with the force. They had hoped that by not training anyone there would no longer be sith or jedi. Whenever the dark or the light would succeed, the other would inevitably come back and the cycle would continue.

Sara decided to fast track the order and start training padawans even though the order didn't have any masters yet. Alessandra suggested that Sara became the first master, but she refused, she knew that in her place she had to keep the balance, and that it could possibly lead to turning against the order. The order needed to remain true to preserving the light, Sara was afraid that she would taint it with the dark side. She didn't want to risk any of the padawans or even knights turning the dark side because of her influence. By the time she reached 24, there were already 2 generations of jedi knights in the order, the first being the ones she trained personally. It was time for the jedi council to return. Alessandra and other formed the jedi council, the became the first jedi masters in years, and started training new padawans.

Trough her meditations she learned more about the force, and the balance that needs to be kept preserving peace throughout the galaxy. She learned about the grey jedis, jedi that didn't side with the light nor the dark, simply the force. They were the balance throughout the force, battling good and evil. She learned about the ancient jedi order, before the republic, the Jed'ai that lived on Tython and how they strived to maintain a balance through out the force. They taught both the light and the dark to the padawans, insisting on the balance between them and how the force is stronger with both. Those who would stray to much towards one side or the other would be sent on one of Tython's moons, either strong with the light or the dark where they would meditate.

## Present day

Sara and other jedi knights were mandated by the council to go aid the republic in the evolving situation. They were assigned to the open circle fleet and deployed on the border with the empire where there had been reports of star destroyers getting close to republic worlds. The tension was rising between the federation, the empire and the republic, no one wanted war, but it seemed just around the corner. The republic was getting worried about the reports that came in from attacks against the federation where lightsaber users attacked cities. Since they could not intervene directly, they asked for the help of the jedi council once more. Sara and 2 other jedi knights volunteered to infiltrate the federation and reach the region where those attacks were reported. Meanwhile the other jedi knights patrolled the outskirts of republic space and kept an eye out for any move from the empire.

## Force powers

- *Battle mediation*
    - Through meditation she can influence the outcome of a combat. While meditating, her allies gain more awareness of their surroundings and increased reflexes.
- *Telekinesis*
    - Using the force and telekinesis she can move objects around and control them using the force. She can pull or push others in combat as well as throw her lightsaber and control it using the force.
- *Mind trick*
    - She can influence others using the force, it works best on those that are less sensitive to the force as they are less likely to be aware of someone influencing their thoughts.
- *Mind probe*
    - She can search through the mind of a submitted subject and find information that she is looking for. It is generally prescribed to use the force for such purposes by the Jedi Order.
-   *Force sense*
    - She can gain extra awareness of her surrounding through for sense, allowing her to see through walls and fog movement around her.
-   *Telepathy*
    - She can communicate with others using the force.
-   *Force bond*
    - She has a force bond with her adoptive sister, Alessandra. She can feel the same emotions, pain that she does. The bond goes both ways, Alessandra can feel what Sara does. It also allowed Sara to train Alessandra on how to master the force rather quickly, the bond allowed some of Sara's powers to have a bleeding effect on Alessandra.

# Alessandra Vasquez

She grew up on Tython with her parents and older brother. When she was three years old, her parent adopted a baby girl at the local orphanage from the city. They named her Sara and she became her younger sister.

As they grew up together they formed a powerful bond that would later prove useful. She didn't know that she was force sensitive as it was not as evident as her sister. She got along with Sara more than her older brother, she didn't know the difference until she was older. They would hangout together and watch Sara do some tricks with the force, messing with other kids at school and such.

## Controlling the force

As Sara grew up and learned more about her force powers, the bond she shared with Alessandra influenced her as well. Alessandra gained more and more aptitude towards the force. Sara showed her a couple of tricks that she couldn't do before. Alessandra gained power as Sara did through a bleeding effect due to their force bond.

It took Alessandra more time than her sister to master some tricks, but she eventually was able to meditate and have visions through the force. She learned telekinesis early on but was never able to see through the force until Sara was much older. At that point Sara had already talked to ancient masters of the jedi order through the force and carried on their teachings. When Sara became a jedi knight, she opened herself to the force, learning much more about the dark side, learning her place in the force. What Sara did had a huge impact on Alessandra, she gained a stronger connection to the force and was able to use more of her powers. She gained the ability to have visions in her meditations, she also was in contact with the ancients of the order. They saw her as the perfect candidate for becoming the new order's grandmaster.

## Forming the new order

Even though the ancient masters thought that Alessandra should be the new grandmaster, she tried to convince her sister, Sara, to become the grandmaster. She was stronger with the force and had a better understanding of it than her. By this time Sara had learned more about the ways of the ancients, and through the force understood more about balance. She knew her place in the force, as a balance in the middle. She knew that her sister didn't yet see it that way, and that the masters of the jedi order before they disappeared didn't see it this way. They thought it would be to dangerous to teach the dark side of the force to find a balance. They were always under the threat of the sith, they were pure dark side users.

Alessandra offered her the title of grandmaster, forming the new order and starting the training of the new jedi order. However Sara refused it, she even refused to train new padawans, she however agreed to help her in creating the new jedi order.

# Shan Harand

Shan went on a reconnaissance mission alongside Sara and Kuna to confirm reports of attacks against colonies.

# Lucas Vasquez

Lucas was born before Alessandra and the adoption of Sara. He was always more of a lone wolf than someone who would get along with other easily. He was 7 years old when his parents adopted Sara, old enough to know she wasn't really her sister. He still managed to get along with her well, but he wasn't a very outgoing person to begin with.

When he saw Sara's force abilities he became jealous of all the attention she was getting, at home and at school.

# Kuna Melanau

Kuna was sent on a reconnaissance mission alongside Sara and Shan on the border of the federation and empire space.
