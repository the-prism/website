title: Mass Effect Heleus - Plan
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->
---

This project was supposed to be a story set in the mass effect universe around the time of mass effect andromeda, set in the milky way and going out on a second expedition to the heleus cluster.

However the project never got out of the planning phase.

Story plan
----------

~~In 2819 the Andromeda Initiative vessel Hyperion reached the Helius
Cluster.~~

~~In 2827, a new prototype mass relay begins construction, the relay
doesn't need a destination relay to exit, only a special mass effect
drive.~~

After some tests, in 2831, the Alacrity, a Normandy SR-4 class vessel is
sent out to the andromeda galaxy in order to establish contact. The crew
volunteered on what is most likely a one-way trip. Plans are set in
motion to send vessels to assemble a relay in the andromeda galaxy
should they establish contact.

Communication beacons are sent months in advance at intervals between
andromeda and the milky way for communications to be possible. This is a
backup system since the Alacrity is equipped with a QEC communicator
with a node on the citadel in the mission control. This allows for
instant communication with the ship no matter where it is in the
universe, in theory.

On July 16, 2831, the SSV-Alacrity departs the citadel and heads for the
prototype relay. They initiate the connection to the relay and engage
the blink drive.

They arrive at their destination almost instantly, exactly how the
relays used to work; the ship shuts down due to an electrical surge upon
exit from the relay channel.

Sarah Vasquez
-------------

Alliance N7 -- Council spectre

Born 22 May 2802

Sarah grew up on Horizon, one of the human colonies. Her parents were
both farmers living on the family farm inherited from generations. As
she was growing up, she helped on the farm here and there. It's when she
started going to school that she discovered she had biotic abilities.
The school proposed to her parents that she transfer to one of the
academies where she could learn to use the powers via an implant. Her
parents refused; they didn't want their daughter joining a military
program part of the alliance navy.

As Sara neared the age to go to high school, she was more interested
about her biotics powers and what she could do with them. She tried to
use her powers but without much success, without an implant it was quite
hard. She knew that her powers could be put to good use, even though her
parents didn't approve. At 18, she joined the alliance biotics program,
leaving Horizon for one of the training facilities. She kept in contact
with her family, even though they didn't approve at first, they
eventually accepted and respected her choice.

She trained for the next two years of her live to control her biotics
via her implant. She received military training and qualified to enter
the OCS after her basic training. Wanting to pursue her school career
she enrolled in the officer program and relocated to Luna where she went
through officer school. She graduated with honors top of her class.

One year later at 21 she was recruited into the Interplanetary Combative
Academy, or ICA in short, for the N program. She spent years on
deployments and training missions finally getting her N7 rank at the age
of only 24, making her one of the youngest N7 graduates. Serving in the
Alliance Navy special forces, she eventually grabbed the attention of
the Citadel security office.

Her name was put for recommendation in the spectre program. After an
audience with the council they approved the decision and she was granted
the rank of the spectre at 26. The Alliance Navy discharged her as she
went on to work for the spectre office, she was no longer in active
service for the Alliance.

When the council drafted up the project for the blink drive, it was kept
under wraps for a while, making sure that it would be feasible. One year
later they started planning the mission to Andromeda. Sarah volunteered
for the mission, her request was granted, and she became the overseer
for the project in 2828 and the mission to explore Andromeda.

Jean-Christophe Beauchamp
-------------------------

Alliance Navy -- Commander

Born 11 July 2799

Military service was something that ran in the Beauchamp family. His
father before him was captain on an Alliance vessel and his mother was
an analyst at a communication outpost. It's no surprise that
Jean-Christophe followed in his parents' footsteps and joined the
Alliance Navy at the age of 18. He eventually served on several vessels
as different roles before being promoted to Commander where he was
second in command on an Alliance dreadnought. He was also selected at
one point to participate in the N7 program, he made it to the rank of N4
before quitting.

Jean-Christophe met Sara while doing his N7 training, they stayed in
contact since. When he heard from her that she became a spectre the two
went celebrating together. They were good friends. When she was assigned
to the Artemis mission, she tried to convince him to join. He refused at
first, not wanting to potentially leave everything behind. But after the
loss of his parents in an encounter with mercenaries, he went through a
tough grieving period. Jean-Christophe eventually agreed to be part of
the program. He was selected to be the SSV-Alacrity second in command.

Jake Bonniwell
--------------

Alliance Navy -- Flight Lieutenant-Commander

Born 25 September 2795

Jake was interested in spaceships and airplanes from a young age. He
played games with some scale models when he was young. When he got
older, he player some video games where he was flying around ships. He
knew he wanted to be a pilot. He went through flight school and
eventually got to fly some airplanes before moving on to ships.

He joined the Alliance Navy at the age of 20, went through officer
school and was eventually assigned as co-pilot on some Alliance ships.
After he got some amount of flight time and seeing a couple of
engagements, he was promoted to flight lieutenant on an Alliance frigate
where he was the main pilot.

Len'ya Aveza
------------

Asari Military -- Communications officer

Born 2 February 2695

Len\'ya wasn't as gifted as other Asari in terms of biotics abilities.
However, as she grew up, she quickly became quite proficient with all
kinds of computers and systems. She was very logical and analytical in
her way of thinking; this made her field of expertise easy for her.
Being only 136, she was still considered young for an Asari. This didn't
stop her from helping develop the new blink drive. She understood how
the relays worked quite easily, and she found a way to improve on it,
what was previously thought as impossible.

Loni\'Vusul vas Vaelazi
-----------------------

Quarian (F) Engineer

Loni'Vusul was born on Ranoch and spent most of her childhood on the
planet. Since the atmosphere was rebuilt with the help of the Geth, now
fully cooperating with the Quarians. She eventually went on her
pilgrimage and spent quite some time onboard various vessels. She
learned a lot about maintenance and how the various systems worked. She
eventually went on the serve as an engineer on the Vaelazi, a Quarian
ship.

Zeeh\'Caal vas Jeewan
---------------------

Quarian (M) Engineer

Zeeh'Caal was raised by his parents on a ship, he learned technology
from a very young age. He always had a knack for disassembling things
and re assembling them afterwards. As he went on his pilgrimage, he
learned a lot of stuff related to engineering, and he eventually became
an engineer onboard the Jeewan. He was eventually promoted to chief
engineer onboard the ship, overseeing all the other engineers on the
ship.

Octaius Rufrian
---------------

Turian weapons engineer

Octaius was born from a noble family, he lived a comfortable life on
Palaven. He always liked to tinker around with stuff, modifying
electronics to repurpose them, create new gadgets and such. He went
through school and started taking classes in engineering, hoping to
learn how to do more complex stuff.

To his family's demise, he eventually joined the Turian military, where
he served as an engineer, working on many different projects. He went
from maintenance to weapons research and everything in between.

Gabilia Opirian
---------------

Turian (F) -- Yeoman

Gabilia was born out of a poor family on Palaven, she lived from city to
city never having a place to stay for a while. She was eventually
abandoned by her parents on the Citadel around the age of six. She
managed to live by herself for a while before eventually knocking on the
door of an orphanage. She was taken in and stayed there until she was an
adult. Since then she found herself some jobs left and right making
herself useful.

Menka Kiot
----------

Drell (M)

Menda trained in various martial arts, making him an excellent hand to
hand fighter. He eventually started a mercenary carer, working for
different organisations, whoever would pay the most. He eventually
Gabilia on one of his missions and became friends with her. Eventually
when she was recruited for the Artemis mission, she managed to convince
him to join.

Bugow Azala
-----------

Salarian (M) - Doctor

Azala was gifted with an incredible thirst for knowledge, nothing was
able to stop him from doing research after research on various topics.
Like most salarians, his mind is racing from thought to thought, being
hard to follow in a conversation about a subject he's passionate about.
One subject he's interested in is biology, and anything related to
living beings. He studied to be a doctor, but he is mostly interested in
research. When the opportunity came with the Artemis mission, he jumped
on the occasion to join the mission and potentially study new species.


Prologue
========

During the last Reaper invasion, survival of many species was at risk.
The reapers were gaining grounds rapidly in the galaxy as they invaded.
But years prior to the invasion, Shepard tried to warn everyone of what
was coming. After having encountered Sovereign, he knew of the threat
that the Reapers posed. However, no one listened.

Except for Jien Garson who founded the Andromeda Initiative in 2176 in
order to explore the Andromeda galaxy. Soon after the failed attack on
the citadel by Sovereign, the initiative also took on a new role, find a
new home for all living species in the galaxy if the Reapers win.

In 2819 the Andromeda Initiative vessel Hyperion arrived in the Heleus
Cluster, sometime after the other vessels as well as the Nexus. The
events that occurred afterwards are unknow to anyone in the Milky Way
since there hasn't been any communication back from the beacons they set
in route. As far as everyone is concerned, the Andromeda Initiative
success is unknown.

In 2827 as the effort to rebuild the Mass Relay network came to an end,
a new project was started. Scientists had the idea to create a new
method of transit that didn't require a destination relay as the system
previously worked. The idea of the new mass effect drive, nicknamed the
blink drive, would allow a ship to enter the relay and exit at any
destination of its choosing requiring only an exit coordinate. The
combination of relay and drive could in theory have increased range
compared to the standard relays, allowing for exploration of previously
uncharted sectors of the galaxy and beyond.

As development of the blink drive and modified relay advanced, it was
discovered that the range of the mass effect drive was far beyond what
was previously imagined. A ship could technically travel all the way to
the Andromeda galaxy. In 2828, the citadel council authorized a special
mission that could end in a one-way trip to the Andromeda galaxy. They
commissioned the SSV-Alacrity, a newly built Normandy SR-4 vessel to be
outfitted with the blink drive and sent on a reconnaissance mission to
the Heleus cluster, where it is believed the Andromeda Initiative
settled.

Chapter 1
=========

Final preparations
------------------

Everything was running smoothly; the blink drive's final calibrations
were underway. The SSV-Alacrity could soon leave the dock it's been
sitting on for the last few months while it undergone retrofits for the
spectre mission. Sarah Vasquez was the spectre in charge of the special
project and the future mission to Andromeda, dubbed Artemis. The entire
mission was a venture into the unknown, following in the footsteps of
the Andromeda Initiative, however there weren\'t any footsteps to
follow. Contact was lost with the Initiative during the Reaper war, the
only thing we have is the available data left behind, on the multiple
destinations, the seven habitats selected.

The Artemis mission was almost guaranteed to be a one-way trip. The idea
was to send a reconnaissance ship in the Heleus cluster of the Andromeda
galaxy to do some initial reconnaissance and then send the sister relay
of the prototype using another blink drive. The mass relay would need to
be deactivated to remove it from its anchor point in space. It would
then be sent through the relay using the blink drive and rejoin the
reconnaissance ship in the Andromeda galaxy. The play relied on a lot of
things going right, tests were done prior to the final preparations,
some aspects of the mission were tested.

Tests to move a mass relay were done, they proved successful in moving a
mass relay using another one with a standard mass effect drive. It was
feasible to move those giant structures that seemed immovable. Tests
were done on the blink drive, it was proven to work, allowing a research
ship to jump to a destination without any relays.

The new relays and blink drive were the culmination in design taken from
the Reapers and the races that came before. Rebuilding the network of
mass relays took centuries for the many races across the galaxy, as the
technology was far more advanced than what was produced at the time. But
the different races of the galaxy united and manage to rebuild the
network. In the process they learned how the relays were built, how they
worked, and most importantly, how to improve on the design. Removing the
need for a destination relay was the primary goal of the blink drive. In
the process of doing so, creating a new relay type and a new mass effect
drive, they managed to increase the range drastically. As they
discovered 3 years ago in 2828, the relay could have a range of millions
of light years away, allowing for travel to other galaxies.

The retrofits done to the SSV-Alacrity mainly consisted of replacing the
mass effect drive for the experimental blink drive. The ship was also
outfitted with a QEC, a quantum entanglement communicator. The QEC would
allow for instantaneous communication with the paired receiver wherever
the ship is in the universe. As a backup, two pairs were installed, the
primary one for communication with mission control on the citadel and a
backup node on Arcturus station for contacting the Alliance. This
retrofit was expensive since the QEC pairs were not easy to come by. But
it was deemed the most reliable way of communication between the Milky
Way and Andromeda, as there was no other possible way feasible for the
near future. The ship was also outfitted with state-of-the-art stealth
technology, the next generation of PHALAX cannons and cutting-edge
weaponry should it come in handy. The kinetic barrier of the ship was
also quite advanced, it could dissipate the energy from a direct hit
from an Alliance dreadnought, the barrier was also able to resist for
some time hits from an Asari dreadnought. But the main advantage of the
ship was its speed, even with 2 of the 4 engines working it could outrun
most fighters, making the ship impossible to catch.

Sarah had a new task to begin, since the ship was almost ready, it was
time to put together a crew for the mission. They would go on a couple
of rehearsals before the final jump, testing the standard relays, then
giving the blink drive a couple of tests before setting out to
Andromeda. She was waiting for Jean-Christophe in the citadel build
where the Artemis headquarters were located. The building was located in
between the slums and docks, having a view on the rest of the citadel
structure. It took a while to get there from the presidium as the
building was located on one of the massive citadel arms.

She had asked Jean-Christophe to join him in the project a couple of
months ago. Since he was going to be the ship's second in command, she
wanted him to be involved in the selection process. Sarah heard a knock
on her office door.

"Comme in" she answered.

Jean-Christophe opened the door and walked in; Sarah got up from her
desk to give him a hug.

"It's been so long, how have you been?" she asked him.

"Not to bad, I'm finally done with my last assignment with the Alliance"
he replied. "And you?"

"Good actually, the ship is almost ready" Sarah replied. "So, you're
moving in here permanently?"

"Well, until we leave" he replied, jokingly. They both chuckled at the
joke.

"Here, have a seat and let's get started" proposed Sarah as she gestured
towards one of the chairs in front of her desk. She moved around and got
back in her seat as Jean was sitting down.

She opened the holographic displays of the station at her desk. She
opened dossiers on many potential recruits. Some they knew, other were
brought forward by the spectre office as potential candidates for the
mission.

They discussed for a couple of hours about the potential candidates and
put up a list to give to the spectre office. The office then contacted
the candidates to inform them about the mission and meet up with the
people in charge of the Artemis mission. They had a rendezvous in a week
at the offices for proper greetings.

\*\*\*

A week had passed, all the candidates had answered, most of them
accepted the offer to join the artemis mission. Many of the candidates
were selected because they had skills and knowledge useful for the
mission. Len'ya had worked on the mass relays and helped develop the new
blink drive that sparked the idea for this mission. Others like
Loni'Vusul and Octaius had worked on the SSV-Alacrity during her
retrofits, they already knew the ship.

They all knew what was at stake, it was possibly a one-way trip to
Andromeda, they might have to spend the rest of their lives there. They
understood the risk of joining the mission, and the possible outcome.
Sara made sure to greet everyone personally, she tried to know everyone
as much as she could. It wasn't easy to get to know everyone of the
crew, there was over 60 people that would be working onboard the
SSV-Alacrity. If the ship was to be fully crewed, it would be over 120
crew members.

The shakedown runs world determines if the mission was to be run with a
full crew or if a minimal crew would suffice. Sara had planned for a
full crew, but the council preferred if possible, to send as few people
as possible on the first mission. They preferred to send a smaller crew
as a reconnaissance mission and overseeing the transit of the return
relay.
